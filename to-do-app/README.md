# To-Do App with ReactJs + Vite

This application was developed with ReactJs + Vite in order to practice adding small projects to my Portfolio. I'm a self-taught programmer and in my free time I prepare quick and relatively easy projects in order to acquire more knowledge in this area in order to be able to enter the working world.
The functionalities of this application are the following:
- Add and delete to-do lists for the daily to-do list.
- Button to change color themes from light to dark.
- Completed and pending tasks section.
Language used ReactJs, Vite, CSS3.
